ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @davidchehet. I've been enjoying machine learning and backend development ever since I implemented my first large Python project,
"Diabetes Detection Model", the big data machine learning model built to detect diabetes in patients and get them the care they need.

I'm currently on the look out for a role in backend development or data science, ideally writing Python or Java. I'd especially love to work in tight knit teams
where I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in building projects around public markets, defense tech, and healthcare.
- ðŸŒ± Fall 2025 Courses: Advanced Models in Deep Learning, Advanced Design Analysis of Algorithms, Cybersecurity, Senior Project, Computer Science Research I, Elementary German I.
- ðŸ“« Connect with me on LinkedIn.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I currently speak 4 languages(English, Spanish, French, and Russian).

One of the domains I enjoy most is finance, specifically financial markets. I am often building projects to help make rational decisions for my investment portfolio, and I also have
a YouTube channel where I am sharing my insights. Check it out below!
